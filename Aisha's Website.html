        <h2>Some Background History about Canadians and their love for Donuts:</h2>

          <p>Personally, I love donuts. My favorite spot to visit is Tim’s Hortons of course, Canada’s most famous coffee shop. 
            Timmies is known for their delicious donuts. My favourite flavours being Boston Cream, Honey Cruller and Chocolate Dip, I always make sure to grab a donut when I’m craving something sweet.
            In wintertime, there’s nothing better than a cup of hot chocolate and a Boston cream donut.
            Donuts are delicious, a great way to spend time bonding with your loved ones and create great memories when the experience is shared.
            Did you know that Tim Hortons has been providing something called Timbits for quite some time now? 
            Tim Hortons does not let the centrepiece of donuts used to create the hole go to waste, they sell them as Timbits in all flavours. 
            Growing up, Timbits has been a memorable sweet for many Canadian children, including me and my siblings. I love the jelly-filled ones, you just can’t get enough!
          </p>
          <p>In Canada, the donut is often thought of as the unofficial national food. Donuts are sold at every intersection and rest stop, celebrated in song and story as symbols of Canadian identity, and one chain in particular, Tim Horton's, has become a veritable icon with over 2500 shops across the country. 
            But there is more to the donut than these and other expressions of 'snackfood patriotism' would suggest. Author Steve Penfold has even written a study for the donut in its’ historical context, published by the University of Toronto Press.

          <p>See how close Donuts are held to Canadians hearts? We have shops selling them, Timbits to preserve them, and texts written about them!</p>

          <h2>Learning more about Tim hortons:</h2>
          <img src="images/timsdonuts.jpg" alt="TimsDonuts" style="width: auto; height: 400px;" class="center">
          <p>Tim Hortons Inc., commonly used by the nickname Tim’s or Timmies is a multinational coffeehouse and restaurant chain founded in 1964 in Hamilton Ontario. 
            Based in Canada with headquarters in Toronto, it’s Canada’s largest quick-service restaurant chain, with 5701 restaurants established amongst 13 countries.
          </p>
          <p>Tim Hortons was founded by Canadian ice hockey player Tim Horton and Jim Charade, and they made sure to have their chain serve coffee, sandwiches, other fast-food items, and of course, donuts!
            In 1967, Horton partnered with investor Ron Joyce who expanded the chain into a multi-billion dollar franchise. On August 26, 2014, Burger King merged with Tim Hortons for US$11.4 billion. This led to a rapid spread of the Tim Horton’s chains,
             and many more donuts to be enjoyed world wide!
          </p>
          <p>Nationally, the Timmies donut that Canadians get the most is Boston cream, and I can tell exactly why! Apple Fritter, Old Fashioned Plain, Honey Cruller and Chocolate Dip make the list for the top 5. 
            Following those, some favourites ate Vanilla Dip, Sour Cream Glazes, Chocolate Glazed, Double Chocolate and Honey Dip.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone should take the opportunity to try a Tim Horton’s donut if they ever get a chance.</p>
